## KiCad Mini Projects

Welcome to **KiCad Mini Projects** â€” a growing collection of PCB designs built using KiCad. These projects are **fully completed in design**, including schematic capture, layout, 3D rendering, and Bill of Materials (BOM), but are **not physically fabricated**. They are fabrication ready in line with JLCPCB's design constraints. They serve as practice and portfolio work for learning PCB design, embedded systems, and electronics engineering workflows.

### Structure

Each project includes:
- `KiCad_files` **Schematic (.kicad_sch)** and **Layout (.kicad_pcb)**
- `BOM` **Bill of Materials (JLCPCB Ready)**
- `exports` **3D Render** and **PNG Files**
- `DESC.md` explaining design overview

---

### Goals

- Build professional PCB designs in KiCad
- Practice embedded and analog layout skills
- Demonstrate ability to complete full design cycles
- Showcase experience for hardware/embedded engineering positions

---

### Skills Learned

- Schematic capture
- PCB layout and routing
- Grounding and power delivery best practices
- BOM generation and design documentation

---

### Projects

| Project | Description | MCU / Chipset |
